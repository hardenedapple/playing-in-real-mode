Small list of rolling targets.

First off, attempt *some* multiboot specification stuff.
    The manual mentions state that a multiboot compliant bootloader must leave
    the machine in by the time the kernel is booted..
    Implement these things one by one.

PUTOFF Jump into GRUB from my bootloader:
    Install GRUB in the partition boot section (not sure what this means), and
    jump into that sector from my bootloader.
    Will have to relocate the code that does the moving of GRUB so that it
    doesn't overwrite itself while copying GRUB into the relevant location in
    memory.

Boot Linux directly from my bootloader, without using GRUB at all.
    Install Linux in a partition on a USB stick, set things up like GRUB would,
    load the environment and jump to the correct place.

Boot Windows directly from my bootloader (on this machine -- eek!)
    Should be pretty much the same -- assuming the windows bootloader knows
    that it's a bootloader stored in a specific partition.
    (and assuming the GRUB bootloader knows the same).

Why is it that `bochs -qf bochsrc.txt` behaves differently to `bochs -f bochsrc.txt`.
